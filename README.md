# school_project
This small project is an introduction to database and pandas.
You have the "iris.csv" file with data about the size of different types of iris flowers.
You should:

load the data in a table in a PostgreSQL database;
add two columns to store real named sepal_area and petal_area, with null default value (can be done at the creation of the database);
calculate the area of the sepal and the petal (supposing that they are rectangular) where the information is null.
